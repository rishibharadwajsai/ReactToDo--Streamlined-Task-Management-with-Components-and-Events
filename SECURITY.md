## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at [rishi.lella123@gmail.com](mailto:rishi.lella123@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. I will respond to you within **2** business days.


### Expectations

- Provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and any necessary proof-of-concept code.
- Allow a reasonable amount of time for us to address the issue you report before disclosing it publicly.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.

### Rewards

We do not offer a formal bounty program at this time.

### Legal

We will not pursue legal action against individuals who discover and report vulnerabilities responsibly. We consider this work to be a valuable contribution to our security efforts and will not take any action to limit or prevent responsible disclosures.
